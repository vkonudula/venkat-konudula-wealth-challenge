To run the app, use the following commands:

- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

- I could not get to the part of implementing the dialog for the asset details due to lack of time. I got to the part where I could at least display the dialog contents.
- There is room for optimization and how I pass the props, especially the `onRowClick` function.
